# Atrex Kernel Agent

AKA is an end-to-end Agent project for GPU kernel implementation, analysis, profiling, and iterative optimization. It helps an Agent turn PyTorch logic or an existing kernel into a high-performance GPU kernel through a structured, profile-driven workflow.

## What It Does

- Creates an isolated optimization workspace under `kernel_opt_<name>/`.
- Looks up target hardware specs from the local `gpu-wiki` knowledge base.
- Runs Roofline analysis and sets auditable performance targets.
- Implements a correct baseline kernel before entering optimization.
- Runs the profile-driven optimization loop: profile with `ncu` or `rocprofv3`, extract bottleneck evidence, query `gpu-wiki` / reference projects / web sources for relevant optimization knowledge, write an evidence-based plan, apply one optimization category, validate correctness and performance, record memory, commit, then repeat until Stop Conditions are met.
- Optionally delegates full-agent **Plan-Execute-Summary** search to the local MLSys26 FlashInfer LoongFlow runner, matching `mlsys26-flashinfer-contest/full-agent/moe/run_moe.sh`. See [`skills/gpu-kernel-evolve/SKILL.md`](skills/gpu-kernel-evolve/SKILL.md).
- Records plans, profile artifacts, structured memory, reports, and Git commits for every accepted iteration.

For the full architecture and workflow design, see [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md).

## Requirements

Installation requires:

- `bash`
- `git`
- `jq`
- A compatible coding runtime installed

Running optimization tasks also requires platform-specific profiling tools:

- NVIDIA: `ncu`, wrapped by `tools/profile_nvidia.sh`
- AMD: `rocprofv3`, wrapped by `tools/profile_kernel.sh`

## Installation

### 1. Internal Development Environment Setup (internal users only — optional)

Internal users should configure git `insteadOf` URL redirect rules so that submodules and
dependencies resolve against the internal network before running `git submodule update` below.
**External users can skip this step entirely.**

### 2. Pull reference-projects Submodule

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Downloads all reference projects managed under `reference-projects/`.

### 3. Run the Installer

```bash
bash install.sh --prefix [install-path]
```

The install path is optional; defaults to `~/aka_kernel_opt`.

Common options:

```bash
bash install.sh ~/my_path          # Install to a custom directory
bash install.sh --hooks-only        # Install or update hooks only
bash install.sh --max-iterations N  # Configure hook stop behavior after memory/vN.json exceeds N
bash install.sh --uninstall         # Remove hooks installed by this script
```

The installer detects supported runtime home directories and prepares local hooks when available.

After installation, restart the coding runtime or open a new session so the hooks are loaded.

## Quick Start

Ask the Agent to optimize a kernel with at least:

- `platform`: target hardware platform, such as `H20` or `MI308X`.
- `framework`: target implementation framework, such as `CuteDSL` or `FlyDSL`.
- `kernel_demo`: path to the initial PyTorch logic or kernel implementation file.

Example:

```text
/gpu-kernel-optimizer Optimize /path/to/kernel_demo.py on MI308X with FlyDSL, dtype bf16, rel_err < 0.01.
```

The Agent will initialize a workspace, source hardware specs from `gpu-wiki`, write the workspace configuration, build a baseline, profile the kernel, and iterate until the configured Stop Conditions are met.

### Full-Agent PES Quick Start

When a request includes the keyword `pes`, Atrex treats it as a request for the real
Plan-Execute-Summary full-agent flow, not the linear optimizer and not a manual single-candidate
loop. For the supported MLSys26 FlashInfer MoE task:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
bash orchestrator/pes.sh moe
```

`orchestrator/pes.sh` delegates to `orchestrator/run_moe_full_agent.sh`, which runs the local
`mlsys26-flashinfer-contest/full-agent/moe/run_moe.sh` LoongFlow runner. LoongFlow owns planner,
executor, evaluator, summary, population memory, lineage, reflections, checkpoints, and target-score
termination.
