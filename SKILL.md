description: End-to-end GPU kernel implementation and optimization router. Use this skill to turn PyTorch logic into a high-performance kernel or to systematically optimize an existing kernel. It initializes the local knowledge base, identifies the current phase, and routes work to baseline implementation, bottleneck analysis, and profile-driven optimization sub-skills.

# GPU Kernel Optimizer Router

This skill owns the global constraints and selects the right sub-skill for each phase.

## Mandatory Rule: Hardware Specs Must Come from gpu-wiki

Any target-hardware spec value, including compute throughput, HBM bandwidth, cache/LDS/SMEM capacity and bandwidth, register counts, SM/CU count, warp or wavefront size, issue rate, occupancy limits, or any other microarchitecture limit, must be sourced from the local `<gpu-wiki>/` knowledge base before use. Unsourced values invalidate the run and must be discarded.

### Hard Rules

1. **No fabrication**: Do not use memory, estimates, model output, web snippets, or verbal user statements as hardware specs in `memory/v<N>.json`, `baseline_plan.md`, `baseline_report.md`, `plans/v<N>_plan.md`, Roofline analysis, target calculations, or any archived decision.
2. **Source every spec**: Record every cited spec in this exact style:
   ```text
   <metric>: <value> <unit> <- <gpu-wiki>/<relative-path>:<line-or-section>
   ```
   Example: `H20 HBM3 bandwidth: 4.0 TB/s <- <gpu-wiki>/docs/hardware/h20_spec.md:L23`.
3. **Ownership**: Authoritative hardware lookup, registration, and downstream decisions must happen in this workflow. Values not registered in the workspace `README.md` or current `plans/v<N>_plan.md` cannot be used as specs, performance targets, or Roofline inputs.
4. **Fixed lookup flow**:
   1. Read `<gpu-wiki>/README.md` first to find the hardware-spec index.
   2. Search target-platform spec documents under `<gpu-wiki>/docs/`, `<gpu-wiki>/ref-docs/`, and other indexed directories.
   3. Register sources in archived files using the required format.
   4. Use the value only after registration.
5. **Missing wiki values**: If a spec cannot be found, write `<metric>: UNKNOWN (gpu-wiki not found)`, record the gap in `memory/v<N>.json` under `pitfalls_and_fixes`, report it to the user, and ask whether a placeholder is acceptable. Do not fill gaps with wording such as "approximately", "should be", "usually", or "similar product".
6. **Auditable archive**: Any reviewer must be able to verify every spec from the local `<gpu-wiki>/` path in the archive. Non-verifiable archives are invalid.
7. **Profiling-driven optimization only**:
   - NVIDIA: `./tools/profile_nvidia.sh`
   - AMD: `./tools/profile_kernel.sh`
   - `triton.testing.do_bench` is the designated tool for end-to-end kernel latency measurement used in Stop Conditions evaluation and performance recording. This is a timing tool, not a profiler — it may determine whether the target is met, but must not replace `profile_nvidia.sh` or `profile_kernel.sh` for identifying bottlenecks.
8. Step 0 computes the performance targets and writes them into `README.md` under `Stop Conditions`.
9. Optimization runs in a temporary workspace and every accepted iteration is committed with git.
10. **Masked memory**: When reading `memory/v*.json` files, check the `masked` field in each file. Skip any file where `masked` is `true`. Masked files are treated as discarded memory and must not influence planning, search deduplication, or optimization decisions. The `masked` field defaults to `false` and can be set to `true` by the `gpu-kernel-partial-restart` agent or by the user manually.

### Scope Without Exceptions

- Baseline performance evaluation against theoretical limits
- Roofline peak FLOPS and peak bandwidth axes
- Memory-bound decisions and target comparisons
- TFLOPS, bandwidth, and absolute target comparisons for every iteration
- Occupancy, register pressure, LDS capacity, and other microarchitecture limits
- Any performance number written into archive files

### Startup Checklist

Before entering any phase or sub-skill that uses hardware specs, confirm:

1. Which hardware specs are needed for this task? Have they been sourced from `<gpu-wiki>/` and registered with the required source format?
2. Does any archived spec value lack a gpu-wiki source? If yes, remove it or add the source immediately.

If any answer is no, complete the missing work before continuing.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the request asks to:

- Implement PyTorch logic as a high-performance GPU kernel
- Optimize an existing kernel
- Analyze kernel bottlenecks, Roofline behavior, or bandwidth utilization
- Move from baseline implementation to profile-driven optimization

## Startup: Create Workspace and Parse User Input

Create an isolated optimization workspace in the **current working directory**。

```bash
bash reference/workspace_init.sh <name> <kernel_demo_path>
```

This script creates the workspace directory structure (`memory/`, `plans/`, `profiles/`), copies the kernel demo as `kernel.py`, initializes git, and creates `.gitignore`. See `reference/workspace_init.sh` for details.

After global constraints are confirmed and before writing the workspace `README.md`, parse configuration from the user prompt. Do not read the current directory `README.md` for configuration. All configuration must come from explicit user input or defaults.

Flow: **parse user input -> decomposition gate (single operator vs whole layer) -> Step 0 (hardware specs + Roofline analysis) -> write workspace README.md**. The gate defaults to **single operator** — the composite/layer path (any input made of more than one separable op, e.g. `rope+attention`, `attention+moe`, or a whole layer) is an optional overlay (see below) and almost every task skips it.

| Field | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `platform` | **Required**. Target hardware platform, such as H20, H100, MI308X, or MI355X. | Ask the user if missing. |
| `arch` | Hardware architecture, derived from platform when possible. | H20/H100/H200 -> Hopper; MI300X/MI308X -> CDNA3; MI355X -> CDNA4. |
| `framework` | **Required**. Programming language/framework, such as CuteDSL or FlyDSL. | Ask the user if missing. |
| `gpu_wiki_path` | Local gpu-wiki path. Do not ask the user to confirm it. | `~/aka_kernel_opt/gpu-wiki/` |
| `reference_project` | Local reference-project path. | `~/aka_kernel_opt/reference-projects/` |
| `kernel_demo` | **Required**. Initial kernel implementation file to optimize. | Ask the user if missing. |
| `additional_notes` | Extra constraints, known bottlenecks, preferred directions, and edge cases. | `none` |

### Parsing Rules

1. Extract fields from the user prompt, for example "optimize on H20" -> `platform: H20`, "write it in CuteDSL" -> `framework: CuteDSL`.
2. Derive `arch` from `platform` using the mapping above.
3. Validate only the `kernel_demo` path.
4. If `platform`, `framework`, or `kernel_demo` is missing, ask the user. Do not guess.

### Decomposition Gate: Single Operator vs Composite (default: single operator)

Immediately after parsing, decide whether the input is a **single operator** or a **composite of more than one
separable op**. This gate **defaults to single operator** — decomposition is a purely optional overlay, and
almost every task bypasses it. The test is *how many separable operators the input contains*, not whether it is
a "whole layer".

- **Single operator (default — the common case)**: one fusion-bounded operator — a single compute primitive
  plus the elementwise epilogue/prologue a real kernel folds in (a matmul, one attention, one norm,
  `o_proj + residual`, `gate_up + SwiGLU`, `fused_add_rmsnorm`, `silu_and_mul`, a quant, a RoPE). Proceed
  directly to Step 0 and the normal Stage 1 -> Stage 2 flow below. **Nothing changes.**
- **Composite (opt-in overlay)**: the input contains **≥ 2 separable ops** that each merit their own kernel
  boundary — e.g. `rope + attention`, `attention + moe`, `qkv_proj + attention`, or a whole decoder layer
  (norm -> QKV -> attention -> o_proj -> residual -> norm -> MLP -> residual) — or the user asks to split. In
  that case do **not** run the single-operator flow directly. Instead invoke the **decomposition overlay**:
  `orchestrator/optimize.py --layer` (rules in `agents/gpu-kernel-decompose.md`), which carves the input into
  fused-operator boundaries, gives **each boundary its own standard workspace** (own Step 0 / baseline /
  optimization / git), schedules a **shared `--max-iters` budget** across them by live ROI (no boundary is ever
  dropped), and finally recombines + validates. Each boundary workspace then runs exactly the single-operator
  flow below.

**When in doubt, treat a single heavy op with light epilogues as one operator.** But any input with two or more
separable ops decomposes — a two-op composite (`rope+attention`) as much as a whole layer.

## Step 0: Hardware Spec Lookup and Theoretical Roofline Analysis

Run Step 0 immediately after parsing user input and before writing the workspace `README.md`.

Goal: use the target `platform` and `kernel_demo` to source hardware specs from gpu-wiki, perform theoretical Roofline analysis, compute absolute performance targets, and write them into `README.md` under `Stop Conditions`.

1. **Lookup hardware specs from gpu-wiki**: Read `<gpu-wiki>/README.md`, follow its indexes, and find exact target-platform specs such as peak TFLOPS, HBM bandwidth, L2/LDS capacity, and relevant bandwidths. Match the exact hardware; do not infer from similar products. Every spec must include a gpu-wiki source and be written into `README.md` under `Hardware Spec`.
2. **Analyze the kernel demo statically**:
   - Compute theoretical FLOPs and theoretical data movement in bytes.
   - Compute `Arithmetic Intensity = FLOPs / Bytes`, compare with the Roofline ridge point, and classify the kernel as compute-bound or memory-bound.
   - Compute absolute targets as `hardware peak * 90%`, preferring gpu-wiki measured maxima when available, otherwise using documented hardware specs.
   - Write the Roofline analysis to `README.md`, including sourced specs, calculation process, bound classification, and absolute targets such as `compute-bound target >= 185.4 TFLOPS` or `memory-bound target >= 3.87 TB/s`.
   - Copy the targets to `README.md` under `Stop Conditions`.

Completion criteria:

- Hardware specs, Roofline analysis, and `Stop Conditions` are written into workspace `README.md`.
- Bound type is determined.
- Absolute targets are computed.

Then proceed directly to writing the workspace `README.md`.

## Write Workspace README.md

Before entering any sub-skill, write the initial session constraints into the workspace `README.md`. The workspace `README.md` stores static configuration parsed from user input, including Task Context and ISA Optimization Targets (previously in `memory.md`). `memory/` stores structured iteration data as per-version JSON files (`memory/v<N>.json`). Files with `masked: true` are skipped during reads. `README.md` and the unmasked `memory/v*.json` files are the source of truth for every later iteration.

Fill `README.md` using `./reference/README.md`. Unknown fields must be `TBD`.

```bash
python tools/memory_manager.py init --workspace kernel_opt_<name>
```

Use `tools/memory_manager.py` for all memory JSON operations (create, read, update, mask/unmask, summary). See `python tools/memory_manager.py --help` for full usage.

If constraints change during the session, such as shape changes or relaxed thresholds, update `README.md` immediately. Do not leave changes only in the conversation.

## Workflow

Run the following phases in order. A phase must pass before the next phase starts.

### Stage 1: Baseline Implementation

**Subagent**: `gpu-kernel-baseline`

Goal: understand the PyTorch logic, extract compute pattern, input/output shapes, dtype, dependencies, and accuracy requirements; learn the target framework API and hardware constraints from `<gpu-wiki>/README.md`; then implement correct `kernel.py` and `test_kernel.py`, validate correctness and baseline performance, and create the starting point for profile-driven optimization.

The main agent must directly launch the `gpu-kernel-baseline` subagent for Stage 1. Do NOT write your own prompt or create an ad-hoc subagent — invoke `gpu-kernel-baseline` by name as a subagent. The main agent must not implement the baseline directly.

Subagent launch instruction:

```
Launch subagent: gpu-kernel-baseline
Task type: editing task
Inputs:
  - workspace_path: <workspace absolute path>
  - pytorch_logic: <user-provided PyTorch logic or kernel_demo path>
  - platform: <target platform, e.g. H20, MI308X>
  - gpu_wiki_path: <gpu-wiki root path>
```

The `gpu-kernel-baseline` subagent will autonomously: read workspace `README.md`; implement `kernel.py` and `test_kernel.py` based on CuteDSL or FlyDSL; run correctness and baseline performance validation; write `baseline_report.md`; write `memory/v0.json`; commit with git.

- **Forbidden**: do not skip `<gpu-wiki>/README.md`; do not fabricate hardware specs; do not modify Stage 2 plans or profiles; do not commit if correctness fails.
- **Expected return**: paths for `kernel.py` (implemented in CuteDSL or FlyDSL), `test_kernel.py`, and `baseline_report.md`; maximum `rel_err`; baseline performance; git commit hash; unresolved issues.

Entry criteria:

- `README.md` exists and includes Step 0 hardware specs, Roofline analysis, and `Stop Conditions`.
- Platform, framework, dtype, shapes, and correctness threshold are clear.
- PyTorch logic, `kernel_demo`, or reference code path is clear.

Exit criteria:

- Stage 1 subagent returned results.
- `kernel.py` exists and must be implemented based on CuteDSL or FlyDSL.
- `test_kernel.py` passes and records max `rel_err` plus PASS/FAIL.
- Baseline performance is recorded in `memory/v0.json`.
- `baseline_report.md` exists.
- Git commit is complete.

Stage 2 (profile-driven optimization) is driven by the **orchestrator** as a series of clean, one-iteration-per-session runs — see `orchestrator/optimize.py` and `orchestrator/prompts/`. When this router is run as the setup session (`orchestrator/prompts/setup.md`), stop after Stage 1: exit once `memory/v0.json` is committed, and let the orchestrator spawn the optimization iterations.

### Stage 2: Profile-Driven Iterative Optimization (orchestrator-driven)

Two search shapes are available for Stage 2:

- **Linear / single trajectory** — [gpu-kernel-profile-optimizer](skills/gpu-kernel-profile-optimizer/SKILL.md):
  the current orchestrator default. Each fresh session performs exactly one profile -> edit ->
  validate -> bench cycle.
- **Full-agent PES / evolutionary** — [gpu-kernel-evolve](skills/gpu-kernel-evolve/SKILL.md):
  select parents from `tools/evolution_db.py`, fan out N isolated candidates, evaluate every
  candidate through the immutable `sol-execbench` harness, admit by score/diversity, summarize, and
  checkpoint. At `n_candidates = 1`, this must behave like the linear loop.

**Bottleneck / Roofline analysis**: inlined in this router — see the **Step 0** section above. There is no separate helper skill.

Goal: approach the performance limit through repeated profile -> code change -> validation cycles.

The linear iteration loop is owned by the **orchestrator** (`orchestrator/optimize.py`), not by a single long session. Each iteration is a fresh `claude` session that runs `gpu-kernel-profile-optimizer` for **exactly one** profile -> edit -> validate -> bench cycle and then exits (see `orchestrator/prompts/iteration.md`). State crosses sessions only on disk (`memory/v<N>.json`, `plans/`, `profiles/`, git): each session reads the prior `open_directions` + recorded dead-ends and starts from HEAD (the best kernel so far). A regressing iteration reverts and is never committed, so HEAD stays best. A PES/full-agent runner uses the same disk-only principle, but stores population state under `database/` and per-child traces under `iteration/<K>/`.

**Termination is mechanical and owned by the orchestrator, not the model**: it stops on a hard budget (max iterations or token budget), or when a committed, correctness-PASS iteration reaches the target utilization in `README.md` under `Stop Conditions` (default: peak utilization >= 90%). A single session never decides to keep looping.

Entry criteria: Stage 1 passed and `README.md` contains Step 0 Roofline analysis and `Stop Conditions`.

Run:

```bash
# Single op:
python orchestrator/optimize.py \
  --op-dir <atrex-bench native op dir> --platform <P> --framework <F> \
  [--max-iters 20] [--token-budget 0] [--target-util 90]

# Composite op / whole LLM layer (decomposition overlay):
python orchestrator/optimize.py \
  --op-dir <atrex-bench native op dir> --platform <P> --framework <F> --layer \
  [--max-iters 20] [--token-budget 0]

# Optional full-agent PES generation with command hooks:
python orchestrator/evolve.py \
  --workspace <kernel_opt_workspace> --init-db --import-seed \
  --planner-cmd <planner-json-command> \
  --executor-cmd <executor-json-command> \
  --evaluator-cmd <evaluator-json-command> \
  [--summarizer-cmd <summarizer-json-command>] [--n-candidates 3]
```

`--op-dir` is the only op input: the workspace name (dir basename), the kernel/layer to optimize
(`reference.py`), the full shape set (`shapes.json`), per-shape SOL (`roofline.json`), and the priority
anchor (`metadata.production_performance`) are all read from it. Only `--platform` and `--framework`
cannot be deduced from the op dir, so they stay explicit.

## Recommended Flows

- PyTorch logic only: Step 0 -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2
- Existing kernel with "why is it slow": Step 0 -> Stage 2
- Roofline analysis only: Step 0 only
- Composite op or whole LLM layer — any input with >1 separable fused op (opt-in overlay): decomposition gate -> `optimize.py --layer` (decompose into boundaries -> one workspace per boundary, each running Step 0 -> Stage 1 -> Stage 2 under a shared budget -> recombine + validate)
